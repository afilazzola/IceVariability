### Notes


Compare variability. Mean change in temperature (30 yr average) vs. sum absolute difference in ice-on date


Test for heteroskedasticity - check if variability has been increasing
Fit a linear model with residuals

Use a non-linear fit

Check for auto-correlation between years


** 
Calculate distance of lake occurrences moving over time (migration) - furthest southern point
One lake model at a time
Which decade does the ice disappear

Split the analysis by different time periods (2070-2099)

Average historical period vs. future (1970-1999)  vs (2070-2099) - to identify anomalies

Create a map that identifies the anomalies (mean and SD)

Hot-spot analysis

Spatial map of temperature


### Jan 29 Meeting
Repeat model comparison with difference between two time periods


Add baseline lake coverage (lakes that were present in the historical dataset)

** Geographic chnage in lake ice coverage
Conduct spatial analysis (Hot-spot analysis)
Add percent change in ice duration based on historic values
Select the northern hemisphere only
Latitude x axis, change in percent ice cover on/off

** How far do lakes retreat
Degrees latitude / decade (how fast are the models retreating)
Calculate the distance between pixels to account for change in latitude to kms

** Check distance from coast (continentality)


** Check Stdev and mean across models for each pixel vs. lake characteristics
