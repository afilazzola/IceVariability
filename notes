### Notes


Compare variability. Mean change in temperature (30 yr average) vs. sum absolute difference in ice-on date


Test for heteroskedasticity - check if variability has been increasing
Fit a linear model with residuals

Use a non-linear fit

Check for auto-correlation between years


** 
Calculate distance of lake occurrences moving over time (migration) - furthest southern point
One lake model at a time
Which decade does the ice disappear

Split the analysis by different time periods (2070-2099)

Average historical period vs. future (1970-1999)  vs (2070-2099) - to identify anomalies

Create a map that identifies the anomalies (mean and SD)

Hot-spot analysis

Spatial map of temperature


### Jan 29 Meeting
Repeat model comparison with difference between two time periods


Add baseline lake coverage (lakes that were present in the historical dataset)

** Geographic chnage in lake ice coverage
Conduct spatial analysis (Hot-spot analysis)
Add percent change in ice duration based on historic values
Select the northern hemisphere only
Latitude x axis, change in percent ice cover on/off

** How far do lakes retreat
Degrees latitude / decade (how fast are the models retreating)
Calculate the distance between pixels to account for change in latitude to kms

** Check distance from coast (continentality)


** Check Stdev and mean across models for each pixel vs. lake characteristics

Compare lake ice loss from ocean lake sheets (Greenland, Arctic, and Antarctic ice sheets)
Compare rate of lake ice loss 
Use binary (lake ice lost in the future)




## April 30th meeting

- look at the mean ice duration - 231 days seems high
- Check to see if the change in duration doesn't match the total duration of ice cover (some lakes with 100+ duration dispear with -70 days)
- Separate line graph change in duration (one panel for permanent ice over vs. seasonal ice cover). Different means
- Create a conceptual figure for the different types of lake ice cover
- get the GDP per capita and emissions per capita vs. change in Ice cover

### May 21 meeting
Be more specific on the variables and include current 
Country and  area of ice lost : 2.6, 6.0, 8.5

Freshwater withdrawal - loss of lake ice cover threatens the water quality


Figure 1 is Conceptual figure: Maps of mean change in duration (on top), line plot of mean change in duration, conceptual figure of different ice types

Figure 2: Change in area of ice cover (3 panels0)




#### June 9th

Revise figures to have points and rolling mean lines

Complete the table to add to the final manuscript - use the figures that Iestyn sent over
